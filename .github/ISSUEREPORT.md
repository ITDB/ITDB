Thanks for wanting to report an issue you've found in ITDB®.
Please fill in the template below by replacing the html comments with an appropriate answer.
If unsure about something, just do as best as you're able.

version:    usually output of `ITDB -v`
platform:   either `uname -a` output, or if Windows, version and 32 or 64-bit.
subsystem:  optional -- if known please specify affected core module name.

It will be much easier for us to fix the issue if a test case that reproduces
the problem is provided. Ideally this test case should not have any external
dependencies. We understand that it is not always possible to reduce your code
to a small test case, but we would appreciate to have as
much data as possible.

Thank you!
